# Contests Repository  

  -----  

  In this repo, you will find my solutions for some contests' problems where I have either done for practice, or actually submitted that solution in the contest. Solutions are sorted by contest, so jump in the directory of the contest you're interested in. I will put the problem in a markdown file (with a link to the original site if possible), and you will find my code to solve that problem under a file with the same name.  

  My solutions are by no means the best, so as always, feed back is welcome.
